      <p>Be specific about what your contest is about, what the format of the results are (is this an ideation challenge?
      An apps contest?), what the prizes are.</p>
      <p>Challenges and initiatives often fail because their organizers are unclear.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Add some examples of what you would consider to be winning entries.</p>
      <p>This will allow your entrants to get an idea of what you are looking for.</p>

      or to let developers know that this is an arts contest.</p>
