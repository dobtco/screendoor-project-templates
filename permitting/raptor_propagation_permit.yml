    are filling in the appropriate application form for the proposed
    activity.</li><li>Please plan ahead. Allow at least 60 days for your application
    to be processed. Some applications may take longer than 90 days to process.

    fee is assessed to partially cover the cost of processing a request. The fee does
    not guarantee the issuance of a permit. Fees will not be refunded for applications
    that are approved, abandoned, or denied. We may return fees for withdrawn applications
    prior to any significant processing occurring.<br><br><strong>Signature</strong><br>

    certification. This means that you certify that you have read and understand the
    regulations that apply to the permit. You also certify that everything included in
