    Public Records Act is designed to give the public access to information held by
    public agencies: "public records are open to inspection at all times during the
    office hours of the&hellip;agency and every person has a right to inspect any
    public record, except as...provided, [and to receive] an exact copy” of an identifiable
    record unless impracticable. (§ 6253).<br><br>According to the Public Records
    Act, the City of San Narciso must:<br><ul><li>help you identify records and information
    relevant to your request,</li><li>allow you to view the records immediately, for
    free, during business hours,</li><li>respond within 10 days</li><li>and justify
    withholding of any records by showing that public interest in confidentiality
    outweighs public interest in disclosure.</li></ul><br><br>The City of San Narciso
    may ask for a 14-day extension if we are required to sort through a large number
    of documents, retrieve the document from a facility outside of City Hall, consult
