    ago, in an effort to expand the scope of our grantmaking, we began soliciting
    letters of inquiry from interested organizations. Now approximately 25% of our
    grants are awarded to projects brought to our attention by a letter of inquiry.<br><strong><br>Eligibility</strong><br>\nOnce
    you have closely read the Foundation's program guidelines and have determined
    \ that the Foundation is accepting proposals in your area of work, the next  step
    is to submit a letter of inquiry. <br><br>\n<strong>Deadlines</strong><br>We admit
    letters of inquiry on a rolling basis.<br><br><strong>Response</strong><br>  \tWe
    will send you an acknowledgment immediately to confirm  that we have received
    your letter of inquiry, and we will direct it to the  appropriate staff members
    for review. The review process for eligible  inquiries can take up to eight weeks,
    unless otherwise noted elsewhere.<br><br><br>  \tAll material submitted becomes
    the property of the Beta Foundation. The Foundation sometimes submits inquiries
    or proposals for  confidential outside review.<br>"
