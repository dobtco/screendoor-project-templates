      First, let's get some basic info about your RFP.
    fields:
      description:
        hint: 'Paste your RFP Here'

      summary:
        hint: 'Provide a brief summary of your RFP.'

      attachments:
        hint: 'Upload any pertinent documents, including your official RFP.'
  responses:
    recommendations: |
      Set the date where you will stop accepting proposals here. After this date,
      bidders will be unable to submit responses to the RFP. If you want to assign
      points to each individual element in your RFP, make sure that "advanced evaluations" is checked.
  response_form:
    name: Bid Form
    recommendations: |
      This is the form that bidders will use to send in answers to your RFP.
      Screendoor helps you score and evaluate RFPs and assign points to each
      individual element, so it's best if you build a form that has every
      component of your RFP in line. This has the added benefit of constraining
      the bidders to only providing you with the information you have asked for.
